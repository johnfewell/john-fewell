# John Fewell's Portfolio Website

Hello there! This is my web dev portfolio site. I created the site in React using Semantic UI. I initially created the site with Create-react-app and added in Semantic UI. I started with an example from Semantic UI and have customized it. The live site is here: [johnfewell.com](http://www.johnfewell.com)
